# Car Reviews Sentiment Analysis with LLMs

This project demonstrates the use of Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis, question answering, and text summarization.

## Project Overview

The notebook in this repository showcases the following:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model to classify the sentiment of car reviews as either positive or negative.

2. **Question Answering**: Utilizing the `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` model to answer questions based on a given context.

3. **Text Summarization**: Summarizing the last review from the dataset using the `cnicu/t5-small-booksum` model.
